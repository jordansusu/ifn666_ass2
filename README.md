# Travel Website :earth_asia: :airplane:
That is a website developed React which can provide users with travel suggestions. It provides two search functions on this website â€“ find attractions and restaurants. The purpose of this website is to help travelers find the information they want more easily by using our interactive website.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install (IMPORTANT!!!!)
Use npm i --force or npm i --legacy-peer-deps rather than just use npm i
Cause there are some version conflict in some libraries. That problem will be fixed in the future release build version.
